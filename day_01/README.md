# 🌟 Expanding Cards

A simple interactive UI built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript featuring five expanding cards, with one active at a time.



## 🚀 How it works
- The UI displays 5 horizontal cards.
- One card is active (expanded) by default.
- When a user clicks on another card, the clicked card expands, and the previously active one collapses.


## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Flexbox layout
- CSS transitions
- DOM manipulation
- Event listeners
- Responsive design (basic media queries)
