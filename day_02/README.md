# 🌟 Progress Steps UI

A clean, interactive progress steps component built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**, featuring step indicators, a progress bar, and navigation buttons.



## 🚀 How it works
- The UI shows **4 steps** arranged horizontally.
- A blue progress line visually tracks your position.
- Clicking **Next** advances to the next step.
- Clicking **Prev** returns to the previous step.
- The current step is highlighted as *active*.


## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Flexbox layout  
- CSS transitions  
- DOM manipulation  
- Event listeners  
- Dynamic styling with class toggling
