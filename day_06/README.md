# 🌫️ Scroll Animation

A scroll-based animation where content boxes slide into view as the user scrolls down the page, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.


## 🚀 How it works
- A vertical stack of content boxes is displayed.
- Each box starts off-screen (left or right, alternating).
- As the user scrolls:
    - Boxes enter the viewport with a smooth sliding animation.
    - The animation is triggered using scroll events and getBoundingClientRect().

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Scroll-triggered animations
- CSS Transforms & Transitions
- Responsive Flexbox layout
- 'getBoundingClientRect()' in JavaScript
- DOM traversal with 'querySelectorAll'
