# 🎯 Split Landing page

A split landing page with two panels that expand on hover, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.


## 🚀 How it works
- The page is divided into two horizontal panels (left & right).
- Each panel starts at 50% width.
- When you hover over one panel:
- It expands to 75% width.
- The other panel shrinks to 25% width.
- Smooth transitions create an engaging visual effect.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Split-screen layout with two horizontal sections.
- CSS variables for easy color and transition management.
- CSS transitions for smooth panel resizing.
- Media queries for responsive adjustments.
- JavaScript event listeners '(mouseenter / mouseleave)' for hover interaction.
