# Form Input Animation

A clean login form where each label animates upward in a wave effect when the input field is focused or contains text, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.


## 🚀 How it works
- Labels are split into individual '<span>' elements using JavaScript.
- Each letter is given a staggered 'transition-delay', creating a wave-like animation.
- When an input is focused or valid:
- The underline color changes to light blue.
- The label letters move upward with a smooth, bouncy animation.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- CSS 'transform' and 'transition' for animations
- JavaScript DOM manipulation with 'querySelectorAll()' and '.innerHTML'
- 'transition-delay' for staggered animations
- Semantic HTML form structure
- Responsive, centered layout with Flexbox
