# 😂 Dad Jokes

A fun little app that serves you hilarious dad jokes every time you refresh the page or click the Get Another Joke button, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.


## 🚀 How it works
- A simple joke box appears with a heading and a `Get Another Joke` button.
- Every time you refresh the page or press the button, a brand-new dad joke is fetched from the API.
- Jokes are fetched from <a href="http://icanhazdadjoke.com/">icanhazdadjoke API.</a>

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Using `async / await` to fetch jokes from an API
- Handling DOM events
- Responsive Flexbox layout
- Alternative approach with `.then()` promise handling
