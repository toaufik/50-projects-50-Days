# 🌊 Collapsible Animated Navigation

An animated vertical navigation that expands and collapses when the hamburger icon is clicked, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.


## 🚀 How it works
- The nav starts as a compact vertical bar with a hamburger icon.
- When the icon is clicked:
    - The navigation expands horizontally.
    - The hamburger icon transforms into a cross.
    - Navigation items appear with a smooth flip/slide animation.
- Clicking the icon again collapses the nav and hides the items.


## 🧠 Concepts Used
- CSS Transforms & Transitions
- Flexbox layout for vertical and horizontal alignment
- DOM manipulation with 'classList.toggle'
- Smooth animations for UI elements
