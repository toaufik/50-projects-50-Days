# 🅾 Incrementing Counter

A simple app that displays social media follower/subscriber counts and animates them from 0 up to the target number, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.


## 🚀 How it works
- Each counter has a 'data-target' attribute containing the desired number.
- On page load, all counters start from '0' and increment until reaching their target.
- JavaScript calculates an increment step for smooth counting.
- Font Awesome icons are used for social media branding.
- The layout is responsive with Flexbox.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- DOM manipulation with 'querySelectorAll'
- 'data-*' attributes in HTML
- Incremental animation using 'requestAnimationFrame' / 'setTimeout'
- Responsive Flexbox layout
